# Instructions for using an Arduino to control RGB LEDs

These instructions cover how to use the Arduino to light up and control an RGB LED. There are two stages to this process. The first stage is to take all the physical components (like the Arduino and LED) and assemble them into a circuit. The second stage is to program the Arduino to control the electrical signals in the circuit.

## Hookup Guide

To hook up all the physical components, first you will gather the parts, then you'll need to connect them with wires.

### Overview of parts

* 1 x Arduino Uno
* 3 x resistors with the right resistance values
* 1 x [RGB LED](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QCE8X.png)
* 4 x [male-to-male jumper wires](https://cdn.solarbotics.com/products/photos/03e0f1ccebb02b4dc5cc17e395d3049b/45040-dscn0624.jpg?w=800). If the wire colors are red, blue, green, and black, it will make debugging easier, but is not strictly necessary.

Arduino Uno:

Resistors: Our resistors are 220 Ohms. You can tell by putting their band color sequence (red, red, brown, gold) into a resistor value calculator.
